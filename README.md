# Automated ab initio workflows with Jobflow and Atomate2 - Cecam school

This repository contains a Docker compose setup for the hands-on sessions of the
Cecam school [Automated ab initio workflows with Jobflow and Atomate2](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/automated-ab-initio-workflows-with-jobflow-and-atomate2-1276) 
held in Lausanne from March 17, 2025 to March 20, 2025.


## Atomate2 + jobflow-remote Docker Setup

This Docker Compose setup provides three integrated containers:
- JupyterLab with atomate2 and jobflow-remote preconfigured for usage.
- SLURM with SSH access to simulate an HPC cluster.
- MongoDB database for workflow data storage.

```

## Configuration

Before building the services **a few values need to be set in the `.env` file** to properly
use the containers and the HPC cluster available during the hands-on sessions. Open the 
`.env` file with a text editor and set the following variables:

* `PROJECTNAME`: name of the jobflow-remote project. Used to also define the folder names.
  It should be a **unique name** to avoid clashes with other users on the HPC clusters.
  Preferably include your name and surname (e.g. `atomate2_john_doe`)
* `REMOTE_USER`: the username for the HPC cluster. **Will be communicated during the hands-on sessions**.
* `REMOTE_PASSWORD`: the password for the HPC cluster. **Will be communicated during the hands-on sessions**.

> [!NOTE]
> The container can be used for local tests even without access to the HPC cluster, thus only
> the `PROJECTNAME` variable is mandatory.

Some of the usernames and ports can be configured in the `.env` file, in case the default values
clash with some of your local services.

### Autoplex environment

Due to compatiblity issues among the different python packages, an additional conda environment
in the jupyter container can optionally be created in order to properly perform the tutorials on
the [autoplex](https://autoatml.github.io/autoplex/index.html) package. To do this set
`CREATE_AUTOPLEX_ENV=true` in the `.env` before building the container.

## Usage

### Starting the Containers

To launch the environment, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the containers are running, verify their status with:

```bash
docker ps
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the containers listed (e.g., `atomate2_school-jupyter-1`, 
`atomate2_school-slurm-1`).


### Services

#### JupyterLab

Based on JupyterLab container, is the main entry point for the execution of workflows during the school. 
The base python environment includes `atomate2`, `jobflow`, `jobflow-remote` and all related 
packages required to execute the workflows. 
Jobflow-remote is already fully configured. 
Connect to http://localhost:8888 (or your custom `JUPYTER_PORT`) and use `atomate` as password.

Can also be accessed through a shell. Run
```bash
docker container list
```
to get the name of the container (similar to `atomate2_school-jupyter-1`) and launch a bash
session inside the container with 
```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash 
```

#### Local SLURM worker

A local worker with slurm to mimic the execution on an HPC cluster. Includes the same
python packages as in the jupyter container and can be accessed through ssh with
```bash
ssh -p 2222 atomate@localhost
```
(or your custom `SSH_PORT` and `SLURM_USERNAME`) from the local machine or with
```bash
ssh atomate@slurm
```
from the jupyter container.
The password is the same as the username.

#### MongoDB

The MongoDB is accessible on localhost:27018 (or your custom `MONGODB_PORT`) from the local 
machine and on mongodb:27017 from the jupyter container. There is no password protection
on the database.
It may be instructive to explore the content of the database with a GUI like
[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass).

#### Volumes

To ensure data persistence across container restarts, the following volumes are mounted:

* JupyterLab (`jupyter_data`):  Stores data in `/home/jovyan/work`. Useful
  files are copied in this folder at container startup.
* SLURM (`slurm_data`): Holds job execution data in `/home/${SLURM_USERNAME:-atomate}/jobs`.
* MongoDB (`mongodb_data`): Persists database records in `/data/db`.

These volumes allow workflows and job results to be retained even if the containers are stopped or rebuilt.

#### Jobflow-remote GUI

The jobflow-remote GUI can be started in the jupyter container running
```bash
jf gui
```
and can be accessed from the local machine connecting to http://localhost:5001 (or your custom `WEB_APP_PORT`).


### Notebooks

The local folder `notebooks` is copied in the jupyter container in the `~/work` folder. 

> [!WARNING]
> Switching on and off the containers will not overwrite the content of the `~/work/notebooks` folder,
> but deleting the `jupyter_data` volume associated will delete the files there.

### Develop folder

The `~/work/develop` folder in the jupyter container is added to the `PYTHONPATH` in the jobflow-remote
configuration, so that it can be used to store newly developed workflows that can be recognised from the
`local_shell` worker.

## Stopping the Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove all data volumes:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This will delete all the notebooks, job files and DB content in the containers.
